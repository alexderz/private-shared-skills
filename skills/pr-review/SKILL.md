description: use this when reviewing a PR or diff before it lands on project-main or trunk, or when the builder is acting on review comments — reviewer is not the builder; two axes (Standards vs Spec); builder verifies comments before implementing.

# PR review

Rewrite. Process from obra/superpowers `requesting-code-review` @ `b36e0829`. Dual-axis from mattpocock/skills `code-review` (Standards vs Spec) @ `3cca18b3`. Id is `pr-review`, not `/code-review`.

**Review skills should not write.** Read, report, escalate. Fixes are a different pass.

Aligns with SDLC **Review**: review **before the item lands on
project-main** (or trunk if there is no project-main). Merge-and-delete
does not skip this. The reviewer is **not** the builder. First review of
this item: mint a **clean** reviewer with crafted inputs (ticket/LLD/spec,
SHAs vs the land target, standards). Later rounds on the **same item**:
**resume that reviewer**. Do not mint a new reviewer each round. Never
give it the builder’s transcript. See
[docs/SDLC.md](../../docs/SDLC.md) (Project-main, Subagents per work
item).

## Iron law

**No land on project-main (or trunk) on builder self-review alone.**
First review is a clean reviewer with crafted inputs — never the
builder’s chat history as the reviewer’s memory. Later reviews of this
item resume that reviewer.

## Always

1. **Pin the range.** Three-dot diff vs **project-main** (or trunk if
   there is no project-main, or another fixed point the manager named).
   Confirm the ref resolves and the diff is non-empty. Do not review
   versus trunk while project-main exists.
2. **Craft context only (first launch).** Description, ticket/LLD/spec
   link, base/head SHAs, standards sources (`AGENTS.md`,
   `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, CONTRIBUTING). Not the builder transcript.
   **Later rounds:** resume the same reviewer; send the new range and
   what changed — do not re-paste the spec.
3. **Two axes, separate:**
   - **Standards** — repo conventions + judgement smells (see baseline). Documented repo rules override smells.
   - **Spec** — ticket/LLD/acceptance: missing, wrong, or scope creep. Quote the requirement.
4. **Report both axes** under `## Standards` and `## Spec`. Do not merge or rerank across axes.
5. **Act:** Critical/Important before merge; Minor can follow. Push back
   with reasoning if the reviewer is wrong.
6. **Reviewer stays read-only.** Do not spawn nested reviewers. Do not
   write, merge, or “just fix it” from the review skill.
7. **Also request review** when stuck, before a risky refactor, and
   after a complex bugfix — not only at the Review land gate.

## Receiving review (builder)

After Review findings, the **builder** loads this section (same skill).
Do not performatively agree. Do not implement before verifying.

1. Read all items. Restate unclear ones or **ask** — do not implement a
   partial set.
2. Check each item against **this** codebase (breaks existing? YAGNI?
   reviewer missing context?).
3. Order: blocking/security → simple → complex. Test each (`tdd` /
   `verify-before-done`).
4. Push back with evidence when the suggestion is wrong for this stack
   or unused (grep). Architectural conflict → operator.
5. Reply on the review thread when the host has one, not only as a
   top-level “fixed.”
6. If you pushed back and were wrong: say what you checked, then fix.
   No long apology.

## Ask first

| Topic | Why |
| --- | --- |
| No spec/ticket available | Spec axis may skip — say so explicitly |
| Skipping a separate reviewer because “tiny diff” or merge-and-delete | Still mint (or resume) the reviewer before land |
| Reviewer wants write/merge tools | Review skill must not grow write privilege; **manager** owns the land |

## Never

| Never | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Self-review as the only Review gate | SDLC: reviewer is not the builder |
| Reviewing versus trunk while project-main exists | Land target is project-main |
| Trust “LGTM” without reading the diff | No evidence |
| Review skill that deploys, merges, or rotates secrets | Review skills should not write |

## Smell baseline (judgement only)

Repo standards win. Skip what tooling already enforces. Label as heuristic, not hard fail unless a documented standard says so:

Mysterious Name · Duplicated Code · Feature Envy · Data Clumps · Primitive Obsession · Repeated Switches · Shotgun Surgery · Divergent Change · Speculative Generality · Message Chains · Middle Man · Refused Bequest

## Roles

| Role | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **architect** | Requesting a clean reviewer (then resuming it) | Treating self-LGTM as Review |
| **builder** | Verify then fix Critical/Important; reasoned pushback | Blind “you’re right” patches; using builder memory as the review |
| **security** | Security axis at PR (trust boundaries); intake | Rewriting product specs in review |
| **tester** | CI evidence the reviewer can cite | Product Spec axis |
| **manager** | Land path (PR vs merge-and-delete); after-act | Blessing land without Review |

## Red flags

- “I’ll just skim it myself in this session”
- “The builder explained why it’s fine”
- “Spawn a new reviewer every round so it stays fresh”
- “We’ll integrate all the item branches at the end”
- Merging Standards pass to hide Spec fail (or the reverse)
- Reviewer opening write tools “to finish the review”
- “Let me implement that now” before checking the codebase
- Nested reviewer subagent from the reviewer
- Skipping review because “it’s simple” or “we’re in a hurry”
