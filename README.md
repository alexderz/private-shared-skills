# Shared skills

Skills here are **tools**, not a marketplace dump. Agents pick the right
tool for the job. The process applies to software, docs, process
changes, and other tickets using this home. SDLC work is keyed by
**role** (`architect`, `designer`, `builder`, `tester`, `security`,
`manager`, `operator`) — not by a named pantheon.

Git is the source of truth. A local or vendor mirror may follow. Do not
treat a mirror as an independent write path for skill bodies.

**License:** MIT ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). `skills/debug-anthropic/` is
Apache-2.0 ([NOTICE](NOTICE)). Pins: [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md).

How the work gets done, in plain language (including a calculator
walkthrough):
[docs/SDLC.md](docs/SDLC.md#how-software-gets-built).

## Roles

| Role | Job |
| --- | --- |
| **architect** | Design, HLD/LLD, adversarial review of approach |
| **designer** | User stories, high-level UX, mockups when there is a screen |
| **builder** | Implement and ship |
| **tester** | Mechanical CI, hooks, cleanup |
| **security** | Security gates across the SDLC, including skill intake |
| **manager** | Process and SDLC after-act. Does not bless ships |
| **operator** | Human in the loop: exceptions, vuln severity, extra hosts |

Improvise beyond predefinition when the work needs it. Do not remint a
skill that already lives here.

## Bundles

There is no plugin manifest yet. For a public copy, these are the
natural install groups:

| Bundle | Skills | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **sdlc-process** | `discover-the-idea`, `ux-design`, `sdlc-artifacts`, `tdd`, `debug`, `docs-google-style`, `verify-before-done`, `pr-review`, `yagni`, `security-hardening`, `shell-safety` | Any repo using this process. Chunk gather-only turns load `discover-the-idea` and no language skill. Incoming items skip that interview. Default debug is `debug`; `debug-pocock` / `debug-anthropic` are alternatives |
| **research** | `buying-researcher` | **researcher** persona when the ask is a buy or market study. Not an SDLC step |
| **languages** | `language-router`, `lang-*`, `golang-safety`, `golang-testing`, `golang-security`, `modern-python` | Writing or reviewing code. Load **at most one** language-family skill per turn |
| **optional / empty** | `tracker-sdlc`, `cursor-cloud-agents-when` | Placeholders. No `SKILL.md` yet. Drop or fill before a public copy |

`lang-go`, `lang-python`, and `lang-shell` are **pointers**. They do not
count as a skill load. They route to `golang-*`, `modern-python`, and
`shell-safety`. `shell-safety` sits in **sdlc-process** because every
agent shell is in scope; `lang-shell` only points at it.

Authoritative pins: [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md). Routing table:
[skills/language-router/SKILL.md](skills/language-router/SKILL.md).

## Intake rules (security first)

Placeholders remain for empty ids. Bodies land via **security** intake
and a compress, not a vendor paste.

- Do not install a second process pack beside this repo’s ids. See
  [docs/INTAKE.md](docs/INTAKE.md).
- Pin every third-party cherry-pick **SHA** in [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md).
  Empty SHA cells mean the body is not here yet.
- **security** intake before any third-party content lands in this repo.
- **No auto-update.** No marketplace install. No scripts. No secrets.
- First-party skills (`tracker-sdlc`, `cursor-cloud-agents-when`,
  language guides) are written here; they are not vendor copies.

Directories under `skills/<id>/` are placeholders (`.gitkeep` only) until
a body lands.
